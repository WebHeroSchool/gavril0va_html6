				Professional deck-builders and DIY’ers alike should take note of a few upcoming changes to deck-building codes. Representatives from NADRA (North American Deck & Railing Association) recently attended the International Code Council Committee Action Hearing for the creation of the 2021 International Residential Code and posted a blog about the updates discussed at the hearing. Here are the highlights in a nutshell, according to Glenn Mathewson, MCP – NADRA Technical Advisor.

			<h3>
				GUARD POSTS
			</h3>
			<p>
				<b>RB185</b>—The most collaborated proposal was related to guard post installation. The update prohibits the notching of 4×4 posts and includes code language requiring the single rim board. However, no specific hardware was specified, keeping the code generic and flexible. The proposal was approved.

			<h3>
				DECK FOUNDATIONS
			</h3> 
			<p>
				<b>RB187<b>—According to NADRA, this was a fairly simple proposal to make better sense of various deck foundation types, minimum depths and frost-depth exceptions. One clarification made was that decks attached to non-frostprotected structures, such as detached garages or sheds, will not have to themselves be frost protected.
